1. First 92 bytes are 0x00
2. Each file are started with 55AA 5AA5
3. Then 4 bytes for Packet(header) Length
4. Then 4 bytes for 0x00000001
5. Then 8 bytes for Hardware ID
6. Then 4 bytes for File Sequence (*)
7. Then 4 bytes for Data file length
8. Then 16 byts for File Date
9. Then 16 byts for File time
10.Then 16 byts for The word Input ?
11.Then 16 byts for Blank with 0x00
12.Then 2 bytes for the Checksum of the header
13.Then 2 bytes for always 0x1000 ?
14.Then 2 bytes for Blank [step 2-14 consumes 98bytes)
15.Then ($headerLength-98) bytes for file checksum
16.Then data file length bytes for files.
17.Then padding if have
18.Then repeat 2 to 17
